## Architecture

**Design contract**: the same binary becomes a code reviewer, Kubernetes triage assistant, or DBA helper purely by mounting different tools, skills, and MCP servers. No code changes required to retarget the agent.

Built on [google.golang.org/adk](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/adk) for the agent loop, session, plugins, and runner.

### Agent topology

```
main.go / server/
    └── agent.NewAgent()            ← single wiring entry point
            ├── Squads              ← one wired tree per squad in agent.json
            │    ├── "default"      ← leader + full team (used when a session omits a squad)
            │    │    ├── leader              ← coordinator (fs tools + planning + mailbox)
            │    │    │    └── a2a_<name>…   ← one tool per peer in a2a_config.json
            │    │    ├── investigator        ← read-only evidence gatherer (tool-wrapped, not transfer_to_agent)
            │    │    ├── web_agent           ← web search + fetch
            │    │    └── summariser          ← condenses bulk output
            │    └── "research"     ← leader + smaller team, selectable per session
            │         ├── leader
            │         ├── web_agent
            │         └── summariser
            └── curator             ← process-wide post-session soft-skill distiller (one hook per generation)
```

A **squad** is a named group `{ leader, members[] }` composed from the
agents defined in `agents.json`. Each chat session selects one
squad at creation (default when none is chosen); the server resolves
`Instance.Squad(name).Runner` per session, so two sessions running on the
same generation can use different squads. Squads only *reference* agents
— skills, tools and MCP servers stay on the agent definitions, so two
squads that share a member also share that member's wiring (and the MCP
pool dedups any subprocess backing it).

Sub-agents are wrapped via `agenttool.New()` and exposed as **tools** on
the leader (not via `transfer_to_agent`), so control always returns to
the leader after a sub-agent call. Only one sub-agent runs at a time
(enforced by `newNonConcurrentTool`). The curator stays a single
per-generation hook listening across every squad.

### Configuration files

Config files are resolved through a **3-layer search chain** (high → low precedence):
`.agents/` (or `agents/` as a dotless alias; both participate when both exist, `.agents/` first) → `$HOME/.yoke/` (per-user) → `/etc/yoke/registry/` (system).

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `agents.json` | List of enabled agent names, model profiles, squad composition, global paths |
| `registry/agents/<name>/agent.json` | Per-agent definition (model_ref, tools, skills, builtin flag, etc.) |
| `registry/agents/<name>/instruction.md` | Per-agent system instruction (markdown) |
| `registry/agents/default.md` | Fallback system instruction for agents without their own |
| `registry/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Authored skill playbooks (YAML front matter: name, description) |
| `mcp_config.json` | MCP server definitions (name, command, args, env) |
| `a2a_config.json` | Remote A2A agent endpoints; each entry becomes an `a2a_<name>` tool on the leader |
| `permissions.json` | Tool permission rules (always_deny / always_allow / ask_user) |
| `filters/` | Bash output filter patterns (token optimization, JSON files) |
| `softskills/` | Curator-distilled procedures from past sessions |

Agent definitions live in `registry/agents/<name>/` directories — mirroring
the skills layout. `agents.json` no longer contains inline agent
objects; its `agents` field is a list of names that reference the registry:

```json
{
  "agents": ["leader", "investigator", "web_agent", "skill_editor", "registries_crawler", "summariser", "curator"],
  "models": { ... },
  "squads": [ ... ]
}
```

Each `registry/agents/<name>/agent.json` is the full `AgentEntry`. A
`"builtin": true` flag marks agents shipped with yoke (leader,
skill_editor, registries_crawler, summariser, curator); custom agents added
by the user omit the flag. The web UI groups them under separate
**Built-in** and **Custom** sections in the agents list.

The registry directory uses the same 3-layer lookup as config files:
`.agents/registry/agents` (and `agents/registry/agents` when that alias dir
exists), `$HOME/.yoke/registry/agents`, then `/etc/yoke/registry/agents` —
first existing directory wins.

### Filesystem layout

Two roots, resolved by [internal/paths/paths.go](internal/paths/paths.go):

- **Read root for config**: a 3-layer search chain, high → low precedence.
  Whichever layer has a given file wins for that whole file (file-level
  override, not deep merge):

  1. `.agents/` (canonical) and/or `agents/` (dotless alias) — project-local
     directories (CWD-relative, highest priority). Both are accepted; when
     both exist, `.agents/` wins and `agents/` is searched right after.
  2. `$HOME/.yoke/` — per-user state root
  3. `/etc/yoke/registry/` — system-wide install (lowest priority)

  Override the chain via `YOKE_CONFIG_DIRS` (colon-separated; replaces
  the chain wholesale).

- **Write root for state**: `$HOME/.yoke/` by default (override via `YOKE_HOME`).
  Agent runtime state (logs, mailboxes, softskills, registry installs) always
  lands here. For user-edited config (the web UI editor + the auto-install
  helpers), yoke is **layer-aware**: when the edited file or any of its
  references already lives in the project-local `.agents/` (or `agents/`)
  layer, the save is routed back to that layer so a local-only project
  never grows orphaned references under `$HOME/.yoke/`. Files originally
  in `/etc/yoke` still fork into `$HOME/.yoke/` on first edit (the system
  layer is read-only). Other state files (logs, mailboxes, softskills)
  remain anchored under `$HOME/.yoke/` regardless of layer:

  ```
  $HOME/.yoke/
  ├── agents.json       # editor writes — user config overrides
  ├── permissions.json  # editor writes — user permission overrides
  ├── logs/             # agent_tasks_*, agent_todo_*, agent_memory_*,
  │   │                 #   agent_statelog_*, agent_events_*, conversation_*
  │   └── uploads/      # web UI file uploads (per-session)
  ├── mailboxes/        # JSONL inter-agent mailboxes
  ├── softskills/       # curator-distilled procedures (read AND write)
  └── registry/
      ├── skills/       # web UI installed skills (override via YOKE_SKILLS_REGISTRY_DIR)
      └── agents/       # web UI installed agents (override via YOKE_AGENTS_REGISTRY_DIR)
  ```

  The web UI editor reads from the search chain and writes to the same
  layer the source file lives in — local files stay local, user files
  stay user, and system files fork to user. For `agents.json` specifically,
  saves are promoted to the **local** layer when the file references any
  agent or skill that only resolves in `.agents/` (or `agents/`), so
  every reference remains satisfied after the write.

  The skill registry (`registry/skills/`) follows the same lookup as
  agent definitions: `.agents/registry/skills` (and `agents/registry/skills`
  when present), `$HOME/.yoke/registry/skills`, `/etc/yoke/registry/skills`
  — first existing directory wins.

### Configuration precedence

`defaults → agents.json → ENV → Options (struct/flags)`

`api_key` and `base_url` values in the config file are resolved as environment variable names first (if an env var with that name exists and is non-empty, its value is used).

### Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `YOKE_PROVIDER` | `anthropic` / `openai` / `gemini` / `openai_compat` (default) |
| `YOKE_MODEL` | Provider-specific model ID |
| `YOKE_BASE_URL` | API endpoint (OpenAI/compat/Anthropic) |
| `YOKE_API_KEY` | Provider API key (also: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) |
| `YOKE_CURATOR_ENABLED` | `true`/`false` — enable/disable post-session curator |
| `YOKE_CURATOR_IDLE_TIMEOUT` | Duration (e.g. `30m`) after which the idle harvester triggers automatic curation for a Web UI session; session is then marked **Harvested** and skipped until new activity; `0` disables (default: disabled) |
| `YOKE_CURATOR_MIN_TURNS` | Minimum model-response count before non-forced curation is considered (default: `3`) |
| `YOKE_CURATOR_MIN_SUB_AGENT_CALLS` | Minimum sub-agent invocations required when no decision is recorded (default: `2`) |
| `YOKE_SERVER_TOKEN` | Bearer token required to start the HTTP server |
| `YOKE_SERVER_ADDR` | HTTP server listen address (default `:8080`) |
| `YOKE_SERVER_GC_INTERVAL` | Period between sweeps that remove orphan files in `$YOKE_HOME/logs` and `$YOKE_HOME/logs/uploads` (default `1h`; `0` disables) |
| `YOKE_HOME` | Per-user state root for all mutable files (default `$HOME/.yoke`) |
| `YOKE_CONFIG_DIRS` | Colon-separated config search chain, high→low precedence. Replaces the default `.agents:$YOKE_HOME:/etc/yoke/registry` |
| `YOKE_CONFIG_PATH` | Explicit `agents.json` path; bypasses the chain |
| `YOKE_SKILLS_REGISTRY_DIR` | Where the web UI installs imported skills (default `$YOKE_HOME/registry/skills`) |
| `YOKE_AGENTS_REGISTRY_DIR` | Where the web UI installs imported agents (default `$YOKE_HOME/registry/agents`) |
| `YOKE_DEBUG` | Log full conversation/event payloads + per-stream SSE timing line |

### Session isolation

Every mutable component scopes its state by `(userID, buildTimestamp)`. Concurrent sessions never share task graphs, todo lists, memory, or mailbox namespaces. All session files land in `$YOKE_HOME/logs/`:

- `agent_tasks_<u>_<ts>.json` — task graph
- `agent_todo_<u>_<ts>.json` — todo plan
- `agent_memory_<u>_<ts>.md` — compressed session memory
- `agent_statelog_<u>_<ts>.json` — full state log (consumed by curator)
- `agent_events_<ts>.log` — event audit log (global per build)
- `conversation_<id>.json` — Web UI turn history + title + `squad` name + `Harvested` flag (server only)

### Hot reload (server mode)

The HTTP server supports rebuilding the agent generation without
restarting the process. Edits to `agents.json`, `permissions.json`, and
`mcp_config.json` (from any layer of the search chain) are picked up by
`POST /api/config/reload` (or the "Reload" button in the web UI).

The model is a two-layer build split across [agent/infrastructure.go](agent/infrastructure.go),
[agent/instance.go](agent/instance.go), and [agent/manager.go](agent/manager.go):

- **Infrastructure** is process-wide and survives every reload: mailbox
  backend, session registry, event bus, ask_user registry, MCP subprocess
  pool, and the session-scoped state holders (tasks, todo, bg queues).
- **Instance** is one agent generation: a map of **SquadInstance** entries
  (leader + sub-agents + plugins + runner per squad) derived from a
  snapshot of RuntimeSettings. Each reload bumps the generation number
  and builds a fresh Instance — with every squad rewired — on top of the
  unchanged Infrastructure. The default squad's leader/runner/plugins
  are mirrored at the top of Instance so legacy callers (CLI, TUI,
  examples) keep working unchanged.
- **Manager** owns the live generations. New sessions pin to the current
  generation and record their squad on the session; the server resolves
  `Manager.LookupSquad(sessionID, squadName).Runner` per turn. In-flight
  sessions stay pinned to their existing generation across reloads, so a
  streaming turn never observes a swap. An old generation is torn down
  once its pinned-session refcount drops to zero.

MCP subprocesses are deduplicated by `(command, args, env)` hash via
[internal/mcp/pool.go](internal/mcp/pool.go): two generations that mount
the same server share one child process. A reload that only changes one
server restarts just that server.

`GET /api/config/status` exposes the current generation and per-generation
refcounts so the web UI can render a "n sessions draining on previous
version" pill. The "Restart server" button stays available as the escape
hatch for changes that hot-reload cannot apply (env vars, binary updates).

### Adding a new sub-agent

1. Create `.agents/registry/agents/<name>/agent.json` with the `AgentEntry` fields
   (`name`, `description`, `tools`, optional `model_ref`, etc.). Omit the
   `builtin` flag for user-added agents. (Use `$HOME/.yoke/registry/agents/<name>/`
   for user-global agents that don't belong to a specific project.)
2. Optionally create `registry/agents/<name>/instruction.md` to provide a
   custom system instruction. If omitted, the agent falls back to
   `registry/agents/default.md`.
3. Add the agent's name to the `agents` list in `agents.json` (from the active search-chain layer).
4. Add the new agent's name to the `members` list of every squad that
   should expose it (omit the entry to keep an agent reserved for one
   squad). If a squad omits the agent, the squad's leader won't see it
   as a delegable tool.
5. `agent.NewAgent()` auto-discovers the agent via `runtime.Agents`; no
   Go code change needed unless you want custom tool wiring
   (`defaultToolKeys`).

### Adding a new squad

Squads compose existing agents. Add a `SquadEntry` to the top-level
`squads:` array in `agents.json`:

```json
{
  "squads": [
    {
      "name": "default",
      "leader": "leader",
      "members": ["investigator", "web_agent", "summariser"]
    },
    {
      "name": "research",
      "description": "Web research focus.",
      "leader": "leader",
      "members": ["web_agent", "summariser"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules enforced at resolution time:

- A squad named `default` is always present; the resolver synthesises
  one (from enabled agents) when missing or when the user adds only a
  non-default squad in the editor.
- `leader` and every `members[i]` must reference an enabled agent;
  `curator` cannot be a member (it is process-wide).
- Duplicate squad names are rejected.

The web UI exposes a Squads sub-tab under Settings → Agent with leader
dropdown, member checkboxes, and add/delete. Hot-reload picks up squad
edits without a process restart.

### Adding a skill

1. Create `registry/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with YAML front matter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: my-skill
   description: One-line description shown in list_skills output
   ---
   # Skill content as markdown instructions
   ```
   The directory name must equal the frontmatter `name` field.

2. Add the skill name to the `"skills"` list in each agent's
   `registry/agents/<name>/agent.json` that should have access to it:
   ```json
   { "skills": ["my-skill", "other-skill"] }
   ```
   An empty list means no skills; the field is absent for agents that
   don't expose the `"Skill"` tool at all.

Hot-reload picks up changes to `agent.json` without a process restart.
The skill files themselves are read on demand at `load_skill` call time.

### Connecting remote A2A agents (client side)

A2A peers are wired via `a2a_config.json` (resolved from the config search chain) — no Go code required.

1. Add an entry for each remote endpoint:
   ```json
   {
     "agents": {
       "peer-yoke": {
         "url": "http://peer-host:8091/",
         "description": "Secondary yoke server.",
         "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${input:peer_token}" },
         "squad": "",
         "session_name": "",
         "create": false
       }
     },
     "inputs": [
       { "id": "peer_token", "type": "promptString", "description": "Peer token", "password": true }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. Add the peer name to `registry/agents/leader/agent.json`:
   ```json
   { "a2a_agents": ["peer-yoke"] }
   ```

3. Hot-reload picks up both files (`POST /api/config/reload`). The leader
   then sees an `a2a_peer-yoke` tool it can invoke with a `prompt`,
   optional `squad`, `session_name`, and `create` arguments.

**Session routing** — when `session_name` is set the remote server looks up
the session by its friendly petname (e.g. `teaching-kite`), runs the turn,
persists it to the session's conversation file, and fires a `mailbox_push`
SSE event to any open web UI tab on that session. When `create: true` the
session is materialised if it does not yet exist (uses the same
`NewWithName` path as `POST /api/sessions` with a name).

**Tool argument precedence**: per-call `squad`/`session_name`/`create` >
`a2a_config.json` defaults > remote server's own defaults.

### A2A server (inbound calls)

`server/a2a_server.go` handles inbound `tasks/send` and `tasks/sendSubscribe`
calls from other A2A agents. Key behaviours:

- **Squad routing**: `metadata.squad` selects which squad the task runs on
  (falls back to `default`).
- **Session routing**: `metadata.session_name` routes into an existing named
  session. `metadata.create: true` auto-creates it if missing.
- **Ephemeral sessions**: omitting `session_name` creates a throwaway session
  per task and discards it after the response.
- **SSE push**: after persisting a turn, `sessionPushBroadcaster.notify`
  fires a `mailbox_push` event so open web UI tabs refresh live.
- **RunGuard**: `sessionRunGuard` serialises concurrent turns on the same
  session (shared with the web UI path — no double-processing).
- **Session name validation**: names must match `[a-z0-9-]{1,80}` (`validSessionName`).

Enable the A2A server via `server.yaml`:
```yaml
a2a_enabled: true
a2a_port: 8091
```

### Remote registries (skills and agents)

The web UI can browse and install both skills and agents from any GitHub,
GitLab, or Gitea repository. Both share the same `remote_registries.json`
file (resolved from the config search chain; with the same fork-on-first-edit semantics as other config), and
the same set of provider adapters in [internal/registries/](internal/registries/).

Each entry has a `kind` field: `skills` (default when missing — legacy),
`agents`, or `both`. The Settings → Skills → Remotes and Settings → Agents
→ Remotes tabs each list only the registries whose `kind` matches; a `both`
entry shows up in both. The "Hosts" selector on the add/edit dialog sets
the kind.

Remote layout — agents:

```
repo/path/to/agents/
├── leader/
│   ├── agent.json        ← required; same shape as registry/agents/<name>/agent.json
│   └── instruction.md    ← optional
└── investigator/
    └── agent.json
```

Remote layout — skills: one `SKILL.md` per subdirectory.

```
repo/path/to/skills/
├── my-skill/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── other-skill/
    └── SKILL.md
```

The browse view discovers either `agent.json` or `SKILL.md` files
recursively under the registry URL's `tree` path. The install button
downloads every file in the matched directory into
`$YOKE_HOME/registry/agents/<name>/` (agents) or
`$YOKE_HOME/registry/skills/<name>/` (skills). After installing a skill,
add its name to the target agent's `"skills"` list in `agent.json` —
either via the web UI Skills tab or by editing the file directly.

The agent install dialog also exposes an "Enable in agents.json"
checkbox — when checked the installed agent's name is appended to the
runtime config's `agents` list so the next hot-reload wires it in.

Use `YOKE_AGENTS_REGISTRY_DIR` or `YOKE_SKILLS_REGISTRY_DIR` to redirect
either install location independently of `YOKE_HOME`.

### Web UI debug mode

The web UI ships with a built-in debug overlay for inspecting streaming
performance and other client-side metrics. Enable it by either:

- Appending `?debug=1` to the URL, or
- Setting `localStorage.agent_toolkit_debug = "1"` (persists across reloads).

A small monospace badge appears in the top-right corner showing live per-turn
metrics:

```
[client] ttfb=120ms  chunks=84  42.3/s  bytes=1980
         render=18ms across 1 parse(s)
[server] ttfb=95ms  chunks=84  44.1/s  total=2010ms
```

- **client** metrics are measured in the browser (TTFB from `fetch()` start,
  cumulative `marked.parse` cost, chunks-per-second based on token-event
  arrival).
- **server** metrics are emitted by the backend as a `debug_timing` SSE event
  right before `done` (see [server/sse.go](server/sse.go) `emitDone`). They
  reflect the rate at which the agent is producing tokens on the wire,
  independent of any browser-side cost.

The instrumentation API is exposed on `window.AgentDebug` for ad-hoc probing
from the browser console. Extend it by adding new fields to the object in
[web/app.js](web/app.js) and calling `_paint()` after mutating state — keeping
the badge as the single surface for new client-side measurements.

Streaming itself always uses incremental Text-node appends; `marked.parse` runs
once per segment at finalize. Don't reintroduce per-chunk markdown rendering —
it makes the UI feel slow even when the wire is fast.
