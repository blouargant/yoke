# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Self-Maintenance Rule

After every major change (new agent, new squad, new tool, new skill, new config file, new package under `core/` or `internal/`, new env var, new HTTP route, new SSE event, new MCP wiring, search-chain/precedence changes, hot-reload behavior changes, architectural shifts), update this CLAUDE.md file to reflect the current state. Specifically:

- Add new agents/squads/tools/skills/packages to the relevant tables and sections below (Agent topology, Key packages, Configuration files, Environment variables, Filesystem layout).
- Update the "Adding a new sub-agent", "Adding a new squad", "Adding a skill", and A2A sections when their procedures change.
- Add any new gotchas, precedence rules, or patterns where they belong (e.g. write-layer routing, MCP dedup, session pinning across hot-reload).
- Keep the configuration precedence chain and search chain accurate when either changes.
- Keep this file as the single source of truth for AI sessions working on this project.

## Architecture

**Design contract**: the same binary becomes a code reviewer, Kubernetes triage assistant, or DBA helper purely by mounting different tools, skills, and MCP servers. No code changes required to retarget the agent.

Built on [google.golang.org/adk](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/adk) for the agent loop, session, plugins, and runner.

            ├── Squads              ← one wired tree per squad in agent.json
            │    ├── "default"      ← leader + full team (used when a session omits a squad)
            │    │    ├── leader              ← coordinator (fs tools + planning + mailbox)
            │    │    │    └── a2a_<name>…   ← one tool per peer in a2a_config.json

            │    │    ├── web_agent           ← web search + fetch
            │    │    └── summariser          ← condenses bulk output
            │    └── "research"     ← leader + smaller team, selectable per session
            │         ├── leader
            │         ├── web_agent
            │         └── summariser
            ├── reflector           ← post-session LLM analyst that tags loaded soft-skills (one hook per generation; optional — heuristic fallback when disabled)
            └── curator             ← process-wide post-session soft-skill distiller (one hook per generation)
```

A **squad** is a named group `{ leader, members[] }` composed from the
agents defined in `agents.json`. Each chat session selects one
squad at creation (default when none is chosen); the server resolves
`Instance.Squad(name).Runner` per session, so two sessions running on the
same generation can use different squads. Squads only *reference* agents
— skills, tools and MCP servers stay on the agent definitions, so two
squads that share a member also share that member's wiring (and the MCP
pool dedups any subprocess backing it).

Sub-agents are wrapped via `agenttool.New()` and exposed as **tools** on
the leader (not via `transfer_to_agent`), so control always returns to
the leader after a sub-agent call. Only one sub-agent runs at a time
(enforced by `newNonConcurrentTool`). The curator stays a single
per-generation hook listening across every squad.

**Soft-skill reflection pipeline** — at `EventSessionEnd`, [agent/load_recorder.go](agent/load_recorder.go)
drains its in-memory bucket (leader-loaded skills, tool errors), runs
the deterministic `softskills.ReflectHeuristic`, applies the heuristic
tags to `softskills/_stats.json`, and emits `EventSessionReflected`
with the gathered payload. [agent/curator_hook.go](agent/curator_hook.go)
subscribes to that event: when a `reflector` agent is enabled it runs
the LLM Reflector ([internal/softskills/reflector.go](internal/softskills/reflector.go))
with a 60-second timeout, merges its Outcome over the heuristic (LLM
wins on overlap), `Retag`s the stats to reflect the override, then
gates and runs the curator. `EventCurateNow` (manual `/learn-now`)
bypasses the reflector and drives the curator directly.

**Sub-agent boundary events** — sub-agents run inside agenttool's private
runner, so neither `EventRunStart/End` nor `EventBeforeRun/AfterRun` fire
on the shared bus for their internal turns. To give reflection hooks a
clean "one sub-agent invocation finished" signal, [agent/subagent_event.go](agent/subagent_event.go)
subscribes to the leader's `EventBeforeTool / EventAfterTool / EventToolError`
and re-emits any payload whose `tool` name matches a sub-agent as
`EventSubAgentStart / EventSubAgentEnd`. Payload keys: `agent` (the
sub-agent), `caller_agent` (the leader), `user_id`, `session_id`, `input`,
`output` (end only), `duration` (end only), `error` (end only, on tool
error), `call_id`, `run_id`. Registered once per Instance from sub-agent
names spanning every squad; subscriptions detach on hot-reload.

**`run_id` on every event** — `EventRunStart / EventRunEnd / EventBeforeTool /
EventAfterTool / EventToolError / EventBeforeModel / EventAfterModel`
all carry a `run_id` field set to ADK's `InvocationContext.InvocationID()`.
It is stable across BeforeRun + AfterRun for a single `Runner.Run` call
and lets [agent/subagent_hook.go](agent/subagent_hook.go) buffer all
sub-agent invocations observed during one leader turn for the Phase 6
per-invocation tagger. Sub-agent internal runs get their own (different)
`run_id`s, so the leader-side `EventSubAgentStart/End` events keep the
leader's `run_id` (which is what we group on).

**Sub-agent reflection pipeline (Phase 6)** —
[agent/subagent_hook.go](agent/subagent_hook.go) opens a per-`run_id`
buffer at each `EventSubAgentStart`, attributes `load_softskill` events
and `tool_error`s to the open invocation, captures the leader's
`AfterModel` text for the lexical reaction scan, and at `EventRunEnd`
walks the buffer to call `softskills.TagInvocation` per invocation
(retry detection via "same sub-agent appears later in the same run",
`Error:` / empty output detection, leader reaction via
`ClassifyLeaderReaction`'s approval / retry / unknown classifier).
Resulting tags are applied to `_stats.json` via `Stats.RecordTag`.

### Semantic recall (embedder + vector indexes)

Four **additive, embedder-gated** recall features share `core/embed` +
`internal/semindex` (a wrapper over the `go-turbovec` pure-Go ANN index,
BitWidth 4 + UnitNorm cosine):

1. **`recall_softskills`** (leader) — semantically ranks curator-distilled
   soft-skills for the user's task; mounted beside the glob `list_softskills`
   ([internal/softskills/recall.go](internal/softskills/recall.go)). Index
   refreshes on call, content-hash gated.
2. **`recall_precedents`** (reflector + curator) — recalls past sessions' goals
   + decisions ([internal/precedents/](internal/precedents/)). Indexed on
   `EventSessionReflected` by [agent/precedents_hook.go](agent/precedents_hook.go);
   backfill via `yoke reindex-precedents`.
3. **`search_code` / `reindex_code`** (investigator) —
   semantic code search over the repo ([internal/codeindex/](internal/codeindex/)),
   `git ls-files`-aware, content-hash incremental.
4. **`search_registries` / `reindex_registries`** (registries_crawler) —
   semantic search over the skills + agents advertised by the configured remote
   registries ([internal/regindex/](internal/regindex/)). Mounted alongside the
   glob `browse_registry` whenever the `registries` tool group is present and an
   embedder resolves. **Metadata-only**: embeds the name/description/tags a
   browse already returns, so no HTTP fetch beyond a normal browse. Indexing is
   lazy (first `search_registries` call) and self-healing (a corpus hash of the
   registry set — ids+urls+kinds — triggers a rebuild in `Search` when it
   changes); a `registries.OnSave` hook also rebuilds in the background after
   any web-UI/tool edit to `remote_registries.json`. Remote *content* drift
   (same URL, changed skills) is only caught by explicit `reindex_registries`.

The embedder and all index handles are process-wide on `Infrastructure`
(`Embedder()`, `Precedents()`, `CodeIndex()`, `RegistryIndex()` in [agent/embedder.go](agent/embedder.go)),
built lazily and surviving hot-reload. **Contract: when no embedder resolves,
none of the recall tools are mounted and every path falls back to glob/grep —
behaviour is byte-identical to a build without these features.** See
[agent/embedder.go](agent/embedder.go) `ResolveEmbedder` for the
`embed_model_ref` → `YOKE_EMBED_*` precedence.

### Configuration files

Config files are resolved through a **3-layer search chain** (high → low precedence):
`.agents/` (or `agents/` as a dotless alias; both participate when both exist, `.agents/` first) → `$HOME/.yoke/` (per-user) → `/etc/yoke/` (system). Agent and skill registries live under `registry/agents/` and `registry/skills/` inside whichever layer you're targeting.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `agents.json` | List of enabled agent names, squad composition, global paths |
| `models.json` | Providers (credentials + endpoint) and reusable model profiles referenced by agents via `model_ref`. Also: embedding models (`"embedding": true` + `"dim"`) and `"embed_model_ref"` selecting the internal embedder for semantic recall |
| `registry/agents/<name>/agent.json` | Per-agent definition (model_ref, tools, skills, builtin flag, etc.) |
| `registry/agents/<name>/instruction.md` | Per-agent system instruction (markdown) |
| `registry/agents/default.md` | Fallback system instruction for agents without their own |
| `registry/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Authored skill playbooks (YAML front matter: name, description) |
| `mcp_config.json` | MCP server definitions (name, command, args, env) |
| `a2a_config.json` | Remote A2A agent endpoints; each entry becomes an `a2a_<name>` tool on the leader |
| `permissions.json` | Tool permission rules (always_deny / always_allow / ask_user) |
| `filters/` | Bash output filter patterns (token optimization, JSON files) |
| `softskills/` | Curator-distilled procedures from past sessions |

Agent definitions live in `registry/agents/<name>/` directories — mirroring
the skills layout. `agents.json` no longer contains inline agent
objects; its `agents` field is a list of names that reference the registry:

```json
{
  "agents": ["leader", "investigator", "web_agent", "skill_editor", "registries_crawler", "summariser", "curator"],
  "squads": [ ... ]
}
```

The `models` block lives in its own `models.json` file alongside `agents.json`.
A startup-time check rejects configs that still declare `models` inline in
`agents.json` — move the block to `models.json` (the loader points at the
expected path in the error message). The file holds two top-level sections:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "openai-prod": {
      "kind": "openai_compat",
      "base_url": "OPENAI_BASE_URL",
      "api_key":  "OPENAI_API_KEY"
    }
  },
  "models": {
    "premium": {
      "provider_ref": "openai-prod",
      "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
      "context_length": 200000,
      "input_token_price_per_million": 5,
      "output_token_price_per_million": 26
    }
  }
}
```

A model's `provider_ref` inherits `kind` (as `provider`), `base_url`, and
`api_key` from the referenced provider; inline `provider`/`base_url`/`api_key`
on a model still override the inherited values when set.

**Embedding model selection (semantic recall).** A model entry may be flagged
`"embedding": true` (with an optional `"dim"`); such entries are *not* picked by
agents via `model_ref` — they show up in the Web UI Models panel's "internal
embedding model" selector and in nothing else. The top-level `models.json`
field `"embed_model_ref"` names which embedding model is the active internal
embedder for all semantic recall (soft-skills, precedents, codebase). It can be
overridden by `embed_model_ref` in `agents.json` and then by the
`YOKE_EMBED_MODEL_REF` env var; when none resolves (and no `YOKE_EMBED_*` env is
set) the embedder is absent and every recall feature silently falls back to its
glob/grep path. The embedder is process-wide (built once on `Infrastructure`,
survives hot-reload like the MCP pool); changing `embed_model_ref` needs a
server restart to take effect.

Each `registry/agents/<name>/agent.json` is the full `AgentEntry`. A
`"builtin": true` flag marks agents shipped with yoke (leader,
skill_editor, registries_crawler, summariser, curator); custom agents added
by the user omit the flag. The web UI groups them under separate
**Built-in** and **Custom** sections in the agents list.

The registry directory uses the same 3-layer lookup as config files:
`.agents/registry/agents` (and `agents/registry/agents` when that alias dir
exists), `$HOME/.yoke/registry/agents`, then `/etc/yoke/registry/agents` —
first existing directory wins. (The registry subdirs sit one level below
their layer's config files: e.g. system has `/etc/yoke/agents.json` next
to `/etc/yoke/registry/agents/`.)

### Filesystem layout

Two roots, resolved by [internal/paths/paths.go](internal/paths/paths.go):

- **Read root for config**: a 3-layer search chain, high → low precedence.
  Whichever layer has a given file wins for that whole file (file-level
  override, not deep merge):

  1. `.agents/` (canonical) and/or `agents/` (dotless alias) — project-local
     directories (CWD-relative, highest priority). Both are accepted; when
     both exist, `.agents/` wins and `agents/` is searched right after.
  2. `$HOME/.yoke/` — per-user state root
  3. `/etc/yoke/` — system-wide install (lowest priority). Agent/skill
     registries live at `/etc/yoke/registry/agents` and
     `/etc/yoke/registry/skills`; every other config file is directly
     under `/etc/yoke/`.

  Override the chain via `YOKE_CONFIG_DIRS` (colon-separated; replaces
  the chain wholesale).

- **Write root for state**: `$HOME/.yoke/` by default (override via `YOKE_HOME`).
  Agent runtime state (logs, mailboxes, softskills, registry installs) always
  lands here. For user-edited config (the web UI editor + the auto-install
  helpers), yoke is **layer-aware**: when the edited file or any of its
  references already lives in the project-local `.agents/` (or `agents/`)
  layer, the save is routed back to that layer so a local-only project
  never grows orphaned references under `$HOME/.yoke/`. Files originally
  in `/etc/yoke` still fork into `$HOME/.yoke/` on first edit (the system
  layer is read-only). Other state files (logs, mailboxes, softskills)
  remain anchored under `$HOME/.yoke/` regardless of layer:

  ```
  $HOME/.yoke/

      └── agents/       # web UI installed agents (override via YOKE_AGENTS_REGISTRY_DIR)
  ```

  The web UI editor reads from the search chain and writes to the same
  layer the source file lives in — local files stay local, user files
  stay user, and system files fork to user. For `agents.json` specifically,
  saves are promoted to the **local** layer when the file references any
  agent or skill that only resolves in `.agents/` (or `agents/`), so
  every reference remains satisfied after the write.

  The skill registry (`registry/skills/`) follows the same lookup as
  agent definitions: `.agents/registry/skills` (and `agents/registry/skills`
  when present), `$HOME/.yoke/registry/skills`, `/etc/yoke/registry/skills`
  — first existing directory wins. (The `registry/` sub-tree is the only
  thing that lives one level deeper than its layer's config files.)

### Configuration precedence

`defaults → agents.json → ENV → Options (struct/flags)`

`api_key` and `base_url` values in the config file are resolved as environment variable names first (if an env var with that name exists and is non-empty, its value is used).

### Permission prompts (ask_user) and grant scopes

When a tool call matches `ask_user` (or no rule), the permissions plugin
([core/permissions/permissions.go](core/permissions/permissions.go))
calls the configured `Asker`. In server/TUI mode the asker is
[agent/permission_asker.go](agent/permission_asker.go), which renders an
`ask_user` SSE widget; in CLI mode it's the `StdinAsker`. The user picks
one of five scopes, ordered by increasing blast radius (`AskOutcome`):

| Choice | Outcome | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Deny | `OutcomeDeny` | Reject this call; next identical call asks again. |
| Allow once (this call) | `OutcomeAllowOnce` | Cache the **exact (tool, args)** probe for the session. |
| Allow all `<Tool>` this session | `OutcomeAllowToolSession` | Cache a **per-tool** grant for the session — every later call of that tool auto-allows regardless of args. In memory only; never persisted. |
| Allow in this project | `OutcomeAllowProject` | Persist an `always_allow` rule with `CWD` = project dir. |
| Allow always | `OutcomeAllowAlways` | Persist an `always_allow` rule with no `CWD`. |

The session-approval cache ([core/permissions/cache.go](core/permissions/cache.go))
holds two granularities: per-call (`m`) and per-tool (`tools`); a per-tool
grant short-circuits before per-call. Both are wiped by `Forget(sessionID)`
on `EventSessionEnd`.

**Persisted-rule breadth** ([core/permissions/persist.go](core/permissions/persist.go)
`buildApprovalRule`) differs by tool: file tools (`Read`/`Write`/`Edit`/`revert`)
broaden to "this tool on **any** path" (`^Write\b`), so approving the first
of N file writes covers the rest — the `CWD` field still scopes "Allow in
this project" to the project tree. `Bash` keeps an **exact-command** match
(a blanket persisted shell allow is a footgun; use the ephemeral
"Allow all Bash this session" grant for command bursts instead).

### Session isolation

Every mutable component scopes its state by `(userID, buildTimestamp)`. Concurrent sessions never share task graphs, todo lists, memory, or mailbox namespaces. All session files land in `$YOKE_HOME/logs/`:

- `agent_tasks_<u>_<ts>.json` — task graph
- `agent_todo_<u>_<ts>.json` — todo plan
- `agent_memory_<u>_<ts>.md` — compressed session memory
- `agent_statelog_<u>_<ts>.json` — full state log (consumed by curator)
- `agent_events_<ts>.log` — event audit log (global per build)
- `conversation_<id>.json` — Web UI turn history + title + `squad` name + `Harvested` flag (server only)

### Hot reload (server mode)

The HTTP server supports rebuilding the agent generation without
restarting the process. Edits to `agents.json`, `models.json`,
`permissions.json`, and `mcp_config.json` (from any layer of the search
chain) are picked up by `POST /api/config/reload` (or the "Reload" button
in the web UI).

The model is a two-layer build split across [agent/infrastructure.go](agent/infrastructure.go),
[agent/instance.go](agent/instance.go), and [agent/manager.go](agent/manager.go):

- **Infrastructure** is process-wide and survives every reload: mailbox
  backend, session registry, event bus, ask_user registry, MCP subprocess
  pool, and the session-scoped state holders (tasks, todo, bg queues).
- **Instance** is one agent generation: a map of **SquadInstance** entries
  (leader + sub-agents + plugins + runner per squad) derived from a
  snapshot of RuntimeSettings. Each reload bumps the generation number
  and builds a fresh Instance — with every squad rewired — on top of the
  unchanged Infrastructure. The default squad's leader/runner/plugins
  are mirrored at the top of Instance so legacy callers (CLI, TUI,
  examples) keep working unchanged.
- **Manager** owns the live generations. New sessions pin to the current
  generation and record their squad on the session; the server resolves
  `Manager.LookupSquad(sessionID, squadName).Runner` per turn. In-flight
  sessions stay pinned to their existing generation across reloads, so a
  streaming turn never observes a swap. An old generation is torn down
  once its pinned-session refcount drops to zero.

MCP subprocesses are deduplicated by `(command, args, env)` hash via
[internal/mcp/pool.go](internal/mcp/pool.go): two generations that mount
the same server share one child process. A reload that only changes one
server restarts just that server.

`GET /api/config/status` exposes the current generation and per-generation
refcounts so the web UI can render a "n sessions draining on previous
version" pill. The "Restart server" button stays available as the escape
hatch for changes that hot-reload cannot apply (env vars, binary updates).

### Adding a new sub-agent

1. Create `.agents/registry/agents/<name>/agent.json` with the `AgentEntry` fields
   (`name`, `description`, `tools`, optional `model_ref`, etc.). Omit the
   `builtin` flag for user-added agents. (Use `$HOME/.yoke/registry/agents/<name>/`
   for user-global agents that don't belong to a specific project.)
2. Optionally create `registry/agents/<name>/instruction.md` to provide a
   custom system instruction. If omitted, the agent falls back to
   `registry/agents/default.md`.
3. Add the agent's name to the `agents` list in `agents.json` (from the active search-chain layer).
4. Add the new agent's name to the `members` list of every squad that
   should expose it (omit the entry to keep an agent reserved for one
   squad). If a squad omits the agent, the squad's leader won't see it
   as a delegable tool.
5. `agent.NewAgent()` auto-discovers the agent via `runtime.Agents`; no
   Go code change needed unless you want custom tool wiring
   (`defaultToolKeys`).

### Adding a new squad

Squads compose existing agents. Add a `SquadEntry` to the top-level
`squads:` array in `agents.json`:

```json
{
  "squads": [
    {
      "name": "default",
      "leader": "leader",
      "members": ["investigator", "web_agent", "summariser"]
    },
    {
      "name": "research",
      "description": "Web research focus.",
      "leader": "leader",
      "members": ["web_agent", "summariser"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules enforced at resolution time:

- A squad named `default` is always present; the resolver synthesises
  one (from enabled agents) when missing or when the user adds only a
  non-default squad in the editor.
- `leader` and every `members[i]` must reference an enabled agent;
  `curator` cannot be a member (it is process-wide).
- Duplicate squad names are rejected.

The web UI exposes a Squads sub-tab under Settings → Agent with leader
dropdown, member checkboxes, and add/delete. Hot-reload picks up squad
edits without a process restart.

### Adding a skill

1. Create `registry/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with YAML front matter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: my-skill
   description: One-line description shown in list_skills output
   ---
   # Skill content as markdown instructions
   ```
   The directory name must equal the frontmatter `name` field.

2. Add the skill name to the `"skills"` list in each agent's
   `registry/agents/<name>/agent.json` that should have access to it:
   ```json
   { "skills": ["my-skill", "other-skill"] }
   ```
   An empty list means no skills; the field is absent for agents that
   don't expose the `"Skill"` tool at all.

Hot-reload picks up changes to `agent.json` without a process restart.
The skill files themselves are read on demand at `load_skill` call time.

### Connecting remote A2A agents (client side)

A2A peers are wired via `a2a_config.json` (resolved from the config search chain) — no Go code required.

1. Add an entry for each remote endpoint:
   ```json
   {
     "agents": {
       "peer-yoke": {
         "url": "http://peer-host:8091/",
         "description": "Secondary yoke server.",
         "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${input:peer_token}" },
         "squad": "",
         "session_name": "",
         "create": false
       }
     },
     "inputs": [
       { "id": "peer_token", "type": "promptString", "description": "Peer token", "password": true }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. Add the peer name to `registry/agents/leader/agent.json`:
   ```json
   { "a2a_agents": ["peer-yoke"] }
   ```

3. Hot-reload picks up both files (`POST /api/config/reload`). The leader
   then sees an `a2a_peer-yoke` tool it can invoke with a `prompt`,
   optional `squad`, `session_name`, and `create` arguments.

**Session routing** — when `session_name` is set the remote server looks up
the session by its friendly petname (e.g. `teaching-kite`), runs the turn,
persists it to the session's conversation file, and fires a `mailbox_push`
SSE event to any open web UI tab on that session. When `create: true` the
session is materialised if it does not yet exist (uses the same
`NewWithName` path as `POST /api/sessions` with a name).

**Tool argument precedence**: per-call `squad`/`session_name`/`create` >
`a2a_config.json` defaults > remote server's own defaults.

### A2A server (inbound calls)

`server/a2a_server.go` handles inbound `tasks/send` and `tasks/sendSubscribe`
calls from other A2A agents. Key behaviours:

- **Squad routing**: `metadata.squad` selects which squad the task runs on
  (falls back to `default`).
- **Session routing**: `metadata.session_name` routes into an existing named
  session. `metadata.create: true` auto-creates it if missing.
- **Ephemeral sessions**: omitting `session_name` creates a throwaway session
  per task and discards it after the response.
- **SSE push**: after persisting a turn, `sessionPushBroadcaster.notify`
  fires a `mailbox_push` event so open web UI tabs refresh live.
- **RunGuard**: `sessionRunGuard` serialises concurrent turns on the same
  session (shared with the web UI path — no double-processing).
- **Session name validation**: names must match `[a-z0-9-]{1,80}` (`validSessionName`).

Enable the A2A server via `server.yaml`:
```yaml
a2a_enabled: true
a2a_port: 8091
```

### Remote registries (skills, agents, mcp, a2a, squads, commands)

The web UI can browse and install skills, agents, MCP servers, A2A peers,
squads, and slash commands from any GitHub, GitLab, or Gitea repository.
All share the same `remote_registries.json` file (resolved from the config
search chain; with the same fork-on-first-edit semantics as other config),
and the same set of provider adapters in
[internal/registries/](internal/registries/).

Each entry has a `kind` field: `skills` (default when missing — legacy),
`agents`, `both` (skills + agents), `mcp`, `a2a`, `squads`, or `commands`.
The Settings → Skills/Agents/MCP/A2A/Commands → Remotes tabs each list
only the registries whose `kind` matches; a `both` entry shows up in
both the skills and agents tabs. The "Hosts" selector on the add/edit
dialog sets the kind.

Remote layout — agents:

```
repo/path/to/agents/
├── leader/
│   ├── agent.json        ← required; same shape as registry/agents/<name>/agent.json
│   └── instruction.md    ← optional
└── investigator/
    └── agent.json
```

Remote layout — skills: one `SKILL.md` per subdirectory.

```
repo/path/to/skills/
├── my-skill/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── other-skill/
    └── SKILL.md
```

Remote layout — commands: one Claude Code-style markdown file per command
(Anthropic's `~/.claude/commands/<name>.md` formalism). The filename
without `.md` is the command name; YAML frontmatter (optional) supplies
`description` and `argument-hint`; the body is the prompt template,
supporting `$1..$N` positional and `$*` rest placeholders.

```
repo/path/to/commands/
├── review.md             ← frontmatter + body
└── triage/
    └── repro.md
```

The browse view discovers `agent.json`, `SKILL.md`, or command `.md`
files recursively under the registry URL's `tree` path. The install
button downloads every file in the matched directory into
`$YOKE_HOME/registry/agents/<name>/` (agents) or
`$YOKE_HOME/registry/skills/<name>/` (skills). Commands install into
the single per-user `$YOKE_HOME/user_commands.json` file (same store
the local Slash Commands editor writes to). After installing a skill,
add its name to the target agent's `"skills"` list in `agent.json` —
either via the web UI Skills tab or by editing the file directly.

The agent install dialog also exposes an "Enable in agents.json"
checkbox — when checked the installed agent's name is appended to the
runtime config's `agents` list so the next hot-reload wires it in.

Use `YOKE_AGENTS_REGISTRY_DIR` or `YOKE_SKILLS_REGISTRY_DIR` to redirect
either install location independently of `YOKE_HOME`.

### Web UI debug mode

The web UI ships with a built-in debug overlay for inspecting streaming
performance and other client-side metrics. Enable it by either:

- Appending `?debug=1` to the URL, or
- Setting `localStorage.agent_toolkit_debug = "1"` (persists across reloads).

A small monospace badge appears in the top-right corner showing live per-turn
metrics:

```
[client] ttfb=120ms  chunks=84  42.3/s  bytes=1980
         render=18ms across 1 parse(s)
[server] ttfb=95ms  chunks=84  44.1/s  total=2010ms
```

- **client** metrics are measured in the browser (TTFB from `fetch()` start,
  cumulative `marked.parse` cost, chunks-per-second based on token-event
  arrival).
- **server** metrics are emitted by the backend as a `debug_timing` SSE event
  right before `done` (see [server/sse.go](server/sse.go) `emitDone`). They
  reflect the rate at which the agent is producing tokens on the wire,
  independent of any browser-side cost.

The instrumentation API is exposed on `window.AgentDebug` for ad-hoc probing
from the browser console. Extend it by adding new fields to the object in
[web/app.js](web/app.js) and calling `_paint()` after mutating state — keeping
the badge as the single surface for new client-side measurements.

Streaming itself always uses incremental Text-node appends; `marked.parse` runs
once per segment at finalize. Don't reintroduce per-chunk markdown rendering —
it makes the UI feel slow even when the wire is fast.

### Web UI todo plan widget

The `todo_write` / `todo_update` / `todo_read` tools do **not** render as the
generic collapsed tool block. Instead [web/app.js](web/app.js) keeps a
per-session plan view in `sessionTodos` (sessionId → `[{task, status}]`) and
renders an "Update Todos" checklist (`.todo-block`, styled in
[web/css/styles.css](web/css/styles.css)) on every todo tool call so users can
follow plan execution: pending = empty box, `in_progress` = spinning marker,
`done`/`failed` = filled box + struck-through text. `todo_write` rebuilds the
list from `args.tasks`; `todo_update` mutates the item at `args.index`. These
calls are routed in the `tool_call` SSE case (via `isTodoTool`) and are **not**
pushed to `pendingTools`, so their `tool_result` is ignored.

Only the latest snapshot per session stays expanded: `sessionTodoBlock`
(sessionId → latest `.todo-block`) lets `appendTodoBlock` add the `collapsed`
class to the prior block when a new one arrives. Any block's header is a
click-toggle, and its `done/total` progress count stays visible while
collapsed. State is live-only (history replay renders text turns, not tool
calls) and both maps are cleared on session delete.
