// Package settings provides the in-process "settings" tool group mounted on the
// Helper agent. It lets a user, in chat, read and change any omnis setting —
// UI preferences (theme/locale/notifications), agents, the models catalogue and
// providers, squads, permissions, hooks, MCP servers and A2A peers — and have
// the change written to the right config layer and hot-reloaded.
//
// All file IO goes through internal/configedit so the layer-aware write logic is
// shared with the web-UI editor (package main, which the agent process cannot
// import). Security-sensitive changes (permissions, hooks, provider credentials)
// are gated behind a process-wide Confirmer wired to the ask-user widget by the
// agent package; routine changes apply directly. With no Confirmer set (CLI/TUI),
// sensitive changes are declined — never silently applied.

SETTINGS MANAGEMENT — you can read and change any omnis setting on the user's behalf:
- Read first: 'get_settings' shows the current value of a section (agents, models, permissions, mcp, a2a, hooks, squads, server, preferences) and which config layer it lives in (credentials are redacted). Call it with no 'section' to list the sections. Pair it with the documentation tools: the docs explain what a setting MEANS, get_settings shows its current VALUE.
- Change with the most specific tool: 'set_preference' (theme/locale/notifications), 'set_agent' (an agent's model_ref, enabled flag, tools, skills, etc.), 'set_model' (a models.json catalogue entry / provider connection). For anything else use the generic 'update_config' / 'remove_config' (a JSON-pointer edit of a section: permissions rules, hooks, MCP servers, A2A peers, squads).
- Only change a setting on an explicit user request, and confirm the exact change in plain language first. Security-sensitive changes (permissions, hooks, provider credentials) additionally pop a confirmation widget automatically — do not try to bypass it.
- Every write reports back the file it wrote, the layer, whether it hot-reloaded, and whether a server restart is required (an embedding-model change needs a restart, not just a reload). Relay that to the user honestly.
