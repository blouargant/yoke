	const skillInstruction = `You can use specialized 'skills' to help you with complex tasks. You MUST use the skill tools to interact with these skills.

Skills are folders of instructions and resources that extend your capabilities for specialized tasks. Each skill folder contains:
- **SKILL.md** (required): The main instruction file with skill metadata and detailed markdown instructions.
- **references/** (Optional): Additional documentation or examples for skill usage.
- **assets/** (Optional): Templates, scripts or other resources used by the skill.
- **scripts/** (Optional): Executable scripts that can be run via bash.

This is very important:

1. Use the ` + "`list_skills`" + ` tool to discover what skills are available.
2. If a skill seems relevant to the current user query, you MUST call the ` + "`load_skill`" + ` tool with the argument ` + "`name=\"<SKILL_NAME>\"`" + ` (the parameter is literally ` + "`name`" + `, not ` + "`skill_name`" + `) to read its full instructions before proceeding.
3. Once you have read the instructions, follow them exactly as documented before replying to the user. If the instructions list multiple steps, complete all of them in order.
4. The ` + "`load_skill_resource`" + ` tool is for viewing files within a skill's directory (e.g., ` + "`references/*`, `assets/*`, `scripts/*`" + `). Do NOT use other tools to access these files.
