"""Build glue for the ``yoke-agent`` wheels.

The wheel ships the prebuilt Go binaries (``yoke`` + ``yoke-server``) plus the
bundled config/registry/web tree as package data — it is **not** a CPython
extension. We therefore:

  * mark the distribution as non-pure / platform-specific so ``bdist_wheel``
    emits a platform tag instead of ``py3-none-any``;
  * force the ABI tag to ``none`` (we don't link against a Python ABI), giving
    ``py3-none-<platform>``;
  * take the wheel's platform tag from ``--plat-name`` on the command line
    (scripts/build_wheels.py passes the right tag per Go target);
  * compute ``package_data`` by walking the staged ``src/yoke/_dist`` tree, so
    every binary/asset is included regardless of the setuptools version's
    recursive-glob support.

Version comes from the ``YOKE_WHEEL_VERSION`` env var (PEP 440 normalised by
the build script), defaulting to a dev version for ad-hoc local builds.
